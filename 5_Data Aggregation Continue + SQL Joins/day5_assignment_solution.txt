Note: please do not use any functions which are not taught in the class. you need to solve the questions only with the concepts that have been discussed so far.

1- write a query to get region wise count of return orders
select region,count(distinct o.order_id) as no_of_return_orders
from orders o
inner join returns r on o.order_id=r.order_id
group by region

2- write a query to get category wise sales of orders that were not returned
select category,sum(o.sales) as total_sales
from orders o
left join returns r on o.order_id=r.order_id
where r.order_id is null
group by category


3- write a query to print dep name and average salary of employees in that dep .
select d.dep_name,avg(e.salary) as avg_sal
from employee e
inner join dept d on e.dept_id=d.dep_id
group by d.dep_name

4- write a query to print dep names where none of the emplyees have same salary.
select d.dep_name
from employee e
inner join dept d on e.dept_id=d.dep_id
group by d.dep_name
having count(e.emp_id)=count(distinct e.salary)

5- write a query to print sub categories where we have all 3 kinds of returns (others,bad quality,wrong items)
select o.sub_category
from orders o
inner join returns r on o.order_id=r.order_id
group by o.sub_category
having count(distinct r.return_reason)=3

6- write a query to find cities where not even a single order was returned.
select city
from orders o
left join returns r on o.order_id=r.order_id
group by city
having count(r.order_id)=0

7- write a query to find top 3 subcategories by sales of returned orders in east region
select top 3 sub_category,sum(o.sales) as return_sales
from orders o
inner join returns r on o.order_id=r.order_id
where o.region='East'
group by sub_category
order by return_sales  desc

8- write a query to print dep name for which there is no employee
select d.dep_id,d.dep_name
from dept d 
left join employee e on e.dept_id=d.dep_id
group by d.dep_id,d.dep_name
having count(e.emp_id)=0;

9- write a query to print employees name for which dep id is not avaiable in dept table
select e.*
from employee e 
left join dept d  on e.dept_id=d.dep_id
where d.dep_id is null;

Loans
A Postgraduate Master's Loan can help with course fees and living costs while you study. Individuals** will be able to borrow up to £12,167 for the purpose of completing an eligible postgraduate Master's qualification. The amount available will depend on the start date of your course.

Scholarships
As a postgraduate student you may be eligible for scholarships in addition to those shown above.

Guidance for Part-time Postgraduate Fees
To complete a standard Master's Taught programme, you must complete 180 credit points.

Full time students will be invoiced for the programme in full upon initial enrolment.

For part-time students, tuition fees are payable each credit point enrolled. To calculate your part-time fees, multiply the part-time fee per credit point by the number of credits you intend to complete within that academic year. This is usually between 60 and 90 credit points per year.

For example, if the fee per credit point for your programme is £51, and you enrol on 60 credits, the tuition fee payable for that academic year will be £3,060.

Fees for enrolment on additional modules
Tuition fees for additional activity are payable by the student/sponsor and charged at the equivalent £ per credit point rate for each module. Additional activity includes:

- Enrolment on modules that are in addition to the validated programme curriculum

- Enrolment on modules that are over and above the full credit diet for the relevant academic year

- Retakes of modules as permitted by the Board of Examiners

Exceptionally tuition fees may not be payable where a student has been granted a retake with approved extenuating circumstances.
