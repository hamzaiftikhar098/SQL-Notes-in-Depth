Note: please do not use any functions which are not taught in the class. you need to solve the questions only with the concepts that have been discussed so far.

1- write a query to get region wise count of return orders.
Solution:
select o.Region, COUNT(distinct(r.order_id)) as total_returns from
orders as o inner join
returns as r on o.order_id=r.order_id
group by o.Region
order by total_returns desc


2- write a query to get category wise sales of orders that were not returned
Solution:
select o.Category, SUM(o.sales) as total_sales from 
orders o left join 
returns r on o.Order_ID=r.order_id
--where r.order_id is null
group by o.Category




3- write a query to print dep name and average salary of employees in that dep.
Solution:
select d.dep_name,AVG(e.salary) from employee e
inner join department d
on e.dept_id=d.dep_id
group by d.dep_name


4- write a query to print dep names where none of the emplyees have same salary.
5- write a query to print sub categories where we have all 3 kinds of returns (others,bad quality,wrong items)
6- write a query to find cities where not even a single order was returned.
7- write a query to find top 3 subcategories by sales of returned orders in east region
8- write a query to print dep name for which there is no employee
9- write a query to print employees name for dep id is not avaiable in dept table
